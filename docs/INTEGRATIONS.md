## Overview

The Falcn integration system allows you to:

- **Forward security events** to SIEM platforms like Splunk
- **Send real-time alerts** to communication platforms like Slack
- **Integrate with custom systems** via webhooks
- **Email notifications** for critical threats

## Configuration

Integrations are configured in the main Falcn configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`).

### Basic Configuration Structure

```yaml
integrations:
  enabled: true
  
  # Global filters (optional)
  filters:
    - name: "high_severity_only"
      type: "severity"
      condition: "equals"
      value: "high"
  
  # Connector configurations
  connectors:
    my_splunk:
      type: "splunk"
      enabled: true
      settings:
        # Connector-specific settings
      retry:
        # Retry configuration
      filters:
        # Connector-specific filters
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Failures

**Symptoms**: Integration tests fail with connection errors

**Solutions**:
1. Verify network connectivity to target system
2. Check firewall rules and proxy settings
3. Validate SSL certificates if using HTTPS
4. Ensure correct URLs and ports

#### Authentication Errors

**Symptoms**: 401/403 errors, authentication failures

**Solutions**:
1. Verify API tokens and credentials
2. Check token permissions and scopes
3. Ensure tokens haven't expired
4. Validate authentication headers
