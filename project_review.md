# Falcn Project Review

## 1. Executive Summary
**Falcn** is a comprehensive supply chain security tool written in Go. it aims to detect typosquatting, dependency confusion, and malicious packages across multiple ecosystems (npm, PyPI, Go, Maven, etc.). The project features a CLI, an API server, and a modular architecture for detection engines.

**Overall Assessment**: The project is ambitious and well-structured, with a strong focus on "enhanced" detection techniques (heuristics, visual similarity). However, there is some structural redundancy between `internal/scanner` and `internal/analyzer`, and the "ML" component is currently a placeholder for simple heuristics.

## 2. Architecture & Directory Structure

The project follows a standard Go project layout:

- **`cmd/`**: Entry points. `cmd/scan.go` uses `cobra` to define the CLI interface.
- **`internal/`**: Private application code.
    - **`analyzer/`**: Appears to be the main orchestration layer used by the CLI. Handles file discovery and parsing.
    - **`scanner/`**: Another orchestration layer. It is unclear if this is legacy or intended to work alongside `analyzer`. It contains its own `ScanProject` logic.
    - **`detector/`**: Contains the core logic for threat detection (typosquatting, homoglyphs).
    - **`ml/`**: "Machine Learning" scorer (currently heuristic-based).
    - **`registry/`**: Connectors for different package managers (npm, maven, etc.).
- **`pkg/`**: Public libraries (types, logger).

## 3. Key Components Analysis

### 3.1. The Orchestration Split (`analyzer` vs `scanner`)
There is a noticeable overlap between `internal/analyzer` and `internal/scanner`.
- **`internal/analyzer`**: Used by `cmd/scan.go`. It implements its own file discovery (`discoverDependencyFiles`) and parsing logic (`parseDependencyFile`).
- **`internal/scanner`**: Contains a full `Scanner` struct with `ScanProject`, `detectProject`, and `extractPackages` methods.
- **Observation**: It seems the project might be in a transition or supports two modes. `analyzer` seems to be the active path for the CLI `scan` command, implementing manual parsing for various lockfiles and manifests.

### 3.2. Detection Engine (`internal/detector`)
This is the strongest part of the codebase.
- **Enhanced Typosquatting**: `enhanced_typosquatting.go` implements a sophisticated multi-factor similarity check:
    - **Levenshtein / Edit Distance**
    - **Keyboard Proximity**: Checks for physical key adjacency (e.g., 'm' vs 'n').
    - **Visual Similarity**: Homoglyphs (e.g., Cyrillic 'a' vs Latin 'a') and leetspeak substitutions ('0' vs 'o').
    - **Phonetic Similarity**: Checks for sound-alike sequences.
- **Heuristics**: It includes specific logic to reduce false positives, such as a whitelist of well-known Maven groups (`org.apache`, `org.springframework`).

### 3.3. "ML" Component (`internal/ml`)
The contents of `internal/ml/scorer.go` reveal that this is currently a **heuristic scorer**, not a machine learning model.
- It applies constant penalties for "No maintainers" (0.2 score) or "Low downloads" (0.1 score).
- While effective as a heuristic, identifying it as "ML" in the documentation is currently aspirational.

### 3.4. Dependency Parsing
The parsing logic in `internal/analyzer` is **hand-rolled** for many formats:
- **Go**: Uses `strings.Split` and prefix checks to parse `go.mod`. This is less robust than using `golang.org/x/mod`.
- **Python**: Uses Regex for `requirements.txt`.
- **Maven**: Uses `encoding/xml` for `pom.xml`.
- **Risk**: Hand-rolled parsers are prone to edge cases, though they reduce external dependencies.

## 4. Code Quality
- **Readability**: The code is generally clean and follows Go idioms.
- **Modularity**: The `detector` package is well-isolated.
- **Configuration**: Uses `viper` for configuration, which is standard and robust.
- **Testing**: There are tests present (`_test.go` files), though the `ml` and `analyzer` tests seem to be unit tests with mock data.

## 5. Recommendations

1.  **Clarify `scanner` vs `analyzer`**: Determine which package is the source of truth for scanning. If `scanner` is legacy, consider deprecating it. If `analyzer` is the new way, ensure it fully supersedes `scanner`.
2.  **Improve Parsing**: Considerations for using official parsing libraries for complex formats like `go.mod` or `pom.xml` where possible, to handle edge cases better.
3.  **ML Implementation**: If actual ML is desired, integrate a real model (e.g., TFLite or ONNX runtime). If mostly heuristics are needed, rename `ml` to `heuristics` or `scoring` to be more accurate.
4.  **Refactor Detector**: `enhanced_typosquatting.go` is very large. Splitting the substitution tables and specific algorithms (keyboard, visual) into separate files would improve maintainability.
