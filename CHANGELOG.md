  - New threat type: `untrusted_signature`

**Phase 2: CI/CD Infrastructure Monitoring** ✅
- **CI/CD Scanner**: Comprehensive workflow vulnerability detection
  - GitHub Actions: Parses `.github/workflows/*.yml` for security issues
  - GitLab CI: Parses `.gitlab-ci.yml` for misconfigurations
  - New threat types: `cicd_injection`, `self_hosted_runner`, `c2_channel`
- **GitHub Actions Security**: Detects Shai-Hulud-style attack patterns
  - Self-hosted runner detection: Flags `runs-on: self-hosted`
  - Code injection detection: 6 patterns including `${{ github.event.discussion.body }}`
  - C2 channel detection: Workflows triggered by `discussion`, `issues`, `issue_comment`
- **GitLab CI Security**: Pipeline security analysis
  - Unknown Docker registry detection (flags non-standard image sources)
  - Hardcoded secret detection in variables section

**Benchmark Scenarios** ✅
- Created `benchmark/scenarios/shai-hulud`: Replicates actual Shai-Hulud 2.0 attack pattern
- Demonstrates self-hosted runner backdoor, discussion-based C2, and code injection

**Phase 3: Runtime Behavior Analysis (Lightweight)** ✅
- **Static Network Analyzer**: Detects runtime threats without Docker sandbox
  - Analyzes JavaScript/Python files for network patterns
  - No performance impact (< 3s per package vs 30-60s with Docker)
  - New threat types: `runtime_exfiltration`, `environment_aware`, `beacon_activity`
- **Exfiltration Detection**: Network data theft patterns
  - GitHub/GitLab API calls from install scripts
  - POST requests with `process.env` data
  - Connections to unknown external domains
- **Environment-Aware Malware**: CI-targeted threats
  - Detects multiple CI environment checks (`process.env.CI`, `GITHUB_ACTIONS`, etc.)
